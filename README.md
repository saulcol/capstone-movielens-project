# Capstone MovieLens project of HarvardX: Build a Movie Recommendetion system using some Machine Learning techniques such as Linear Model 

The project is composed of 3 files: `code_movielens_proj.R`, `report_movielens_proj.Rmd` and
`report_movielens_proj.pdf`.  

For this specific project, the structure of its directories is:  

- **capstone-movielens-project**/
    - **rdas**/
        - cp_movielens.rda
        - cp_movielens_train_test.rda
    - **ml-10M100K**/ (raw_data dir)
        - movies.dat
        - ratings.dat
- README.md
- report_movielens_proj.Rmd
- code_movielens_proj.R
- report_movielens_proj.pdf
<br />
## The `code_movielens_proj.R` file

This file contents all the code used from prepare the project and download the datasets from a
specific internet site until build and test the Final Linear Model for a Movie Recommendetion system.  
<br />
## The `report_movielens_proj.Rmd` document

This `Rmd` document was renderized to generate the PDF document `report_movielens_proj.pdf`.  
<br />
## The `report_movielens_proj.pdf` final report

This is the final report that was generated from the `Rmd` document. And it consists of 4 chapters and by an extra section called Appendix,
which are described as follows: **Chapter 1 Overview** describes the dataset, summarizes the
goal of the project and key steps that were performed. In **Chapter 2 Methods and Analysis**
explains the process and techniques used, for example, data science project preparation, data
exploration and visualization, preparation and cleaning of the training and testing datasets.
Also, the insights gained during the course, and the modeling approach used. **Chapter 3 Results**
presents the modeling results and discusses the model performance. In **Chapter 4 Conclusion**
gives a brief summary of the report, its limitations and future work. And finally, in the extra
section **Appendix**, that is divided into two parts, shows the information about the computer
equipment used, its hardware specs, `R` session, the Operating Systems (OS) where this code was
made (Appendix A) and tested (Appendix B), and the loaded packages.
